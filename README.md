# Single-Resource-API
A simple API that receives requests and sends JSON as a response


#### Learning Objectives

- Full CRUD API for a single resource

#### Prerequisites

- JavaScript
- Node / Express

---

### Setting up

1. create a new repo for this on your personal github, name it after your chosen resource

2. Follow the best practices described and test your routes with postman. (for an extra challenge, take a look at the curl scripts in the boilerplate and see if you can write/run your own!)

3. AUTH is NOT required, but would be realitvely easy to implement if fully utilizing the boilerplate.

### Routes

- Index
  - GET `/<resource_name>`<br>
- Show
  - GET `/<resource_name>/:id`<br>
- Create
  - POST `/<resource_name>`<br>
- Update
  - PUT `/<resource_name>/:id`<br>
- Destroy
  - DELETE `/<resource_name>/:id`<br>
